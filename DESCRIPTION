Description: Provides tools for simulating from continuous-time individual level models of disease transmission, and carrying out infectious disease data analyses with the same models. The epidemic models considered are distance-based and/or contact network-based models within Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) or Susceptible-Infectious-Notified-Removed (SINR) compartmental frameworks. An overview of the implemented continuous-time individual level models for epidemics is given by Almutiry and Deardon (2019) <doi:10.1515/ijb-2017-0092>.
